Given two sets of elements, we are asked to find the sum of all distinct elements from the set. In other words, 
find the sum of all elements which are present in either of the given set.
we will go with the solution with an array,so:
 a) we will begin with Initializing: sum = 0. 
 b) we Compare each element of set one with the second set and if element is not present then we add that element to sum. 
 c) do the vice versa to add elements from the second set.
